Description: Performs time-series discretization and transformation to networks. 
    Supports discretization of univariate time series data by binning, kernel 
    density estimation, gaussian mixtures, and k-means among others. Various 
    methods for distance-based network transformations are supported including 
    k-nearest neighbors and gaussian kernels.
